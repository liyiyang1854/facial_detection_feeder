For the robot arm, we use Dynamixel AX-12A Robot Actuator and ArbotiX-M Robocontroller which is compatible with arduino sketch. There are five steps for the whole process:  <br />
1. wait until the pos error is small <br />
2. grab food <br />
3. move to the position <br />
4. hold for some time <br />
5. move back <br />
